your comments are generally good but not strongly motivates, and they do not address confusion/ambiguity/color compliance in detail

9.5/10


YOUR PLOT
=========

good plot, good choice of BW and mean/median in read that highlights it. 

consider using a larger unit on the y axis (miles?)


SOME NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
====================================

===========
unmotivated empty space to the right

the choice of red single color is "aggressive" to the sight, which may or may not be the desired effect given context. but it is a color that does not comply well with color blindness, so if that is the desired effect it would be lost in 10% of the male population

axis labels a bit small 


ACoffy

this is a tableau like visualization more than a plot

it is a little crowded (remember the rule of 7 elements max) but well organized, so still readable

the legend does not need the title legend

the cardinal pints cloud be indicated more elegantly and simply by 2 arrows 

the data shown is ambiguous and the legend does not help at all: less than 250 what? (crimes presumably but not clear) and what is the difference in what is plotted by points and colored areas?

poverty level and serious crimes labels miss units

the size scale with the three steps per unit is crowding the plot and it is redundant

=======

the differences year by year are tiny so it is hard to understand why they are highlighted as they are by color: it is what draws most of the attention and it is not the message that tries to be conveyed. 

axis labels too small

the units on the y axis should be compresses: use tens of thousands and plot single digit numbers

colors are lost by the 10% of the population that is color blind that cannot tell the difference between 2007 and 2008 etc
